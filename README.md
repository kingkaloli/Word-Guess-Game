# The Physic Game 

## What this project does:

The Physic Game is a game that a user guesses the same letters the application is 
thinking of. Rather than having a user guess letters in the whole alphabet, this 
application limited the choices to "IMPHYSIC". This format enhances the odds of a 
user winning the game. 


## Why the project is useful:

This project is useful because it greatly challenged my understanding of Javascript.
The most challenging part was doubling the for loop to make the application spit 
out the letters repeatedly. 

## Where users can get help with your project:
